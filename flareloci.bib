        coronal mass ejections (CMEs). We have analysed spectroscopic
        observations, BV(RI)$_{C}$ photometry covering 5 yrs, and
        additional R$_{C}$ photometry that expands the temporal base
        over 16 yr. The light curve suggests an almost rigid-body
        rotation and a spot configuration that is stable over about 16
        yrs, confirming the previous indications of a very stable
        magnetic field. We observed small changes on a nightly timescale
        and frequent flaring, including a possible sympathetic flare.
        The strongest flares seem to be more concentrated around the

        (0,0) band of the A$^{6}${\ensuremath{\Sigma}}$^{+}$ -
        X$^{6}${\ensuremath{\Sigma}}$^{+}$ system of the CrH molecule,
        and we examined its potential for estimating magnetic fields on
        stars and substellar objects, such as brown dwarfs and hot
        exoplanets. \textbackslash Methods: We carried out quantum
        mechanical calculations to obtain the energy level structure of
        the electronic-vibrational-rotational states considered both in
        the absence and in the presence of a magnetic field. Level
        mixing due to magnetic field perturbation (the Paschen-Back
        effect) was consistently taken into account. Then, we calculated
        frequencies and strengths of transitions between magnetic
        sublevels. Employing these results and solving numerically a set
        of the radiative transfer equations for polarized radiation, we
        calculated Stokes parameters for both the individual lines and
        the (0,0) band depending on the strength and orientation of the
        magnetic field. \textbackslash Results: We demonstrate that
        magnetic splitting of the individual CrH lines shows a
        significant asymmetry due to the Paschen-Back effect already at
        1 G field. This leads to a considerable signal in both circular
        and linear polarization, up to 30\% at the magnetic field
        strength of {\ensuremath{\geq}}3 kG in early L dwarfs. The
        polarization does not cancel out completely even at very low
        spectral resolution and is seen as broad-band polarization of a
        few percent. Since the line asymmetry depends only on the
        magnetic field strength and not on the filling factor, CrH lines
        provide a very sensitive tool for direct measurement of the
        stellar magnetic fields on faint cool objects, such as brown
        dwarfs and hot Jupiters, observed with low spectral resolution.}",

        did not have previous measurements in the literature. For the

        targets are fast rotators (v sin i $\gt$ 30 km s$^{-1}$). As
        fast rotation causes spectral features to be washed out, stars
        with low projected rotational velocities are sought for radial
        velocity surveys. At our intermediate spectral resolution, we
        have confirmed the identification of neutral atomic lines
        reported in McLean et al. We also calculated pseudo-equivalent
        widths of 12 atomic lines. Our results confirm that the pseudo-
        equivalent width of K I lines is strongly dependent on spectral
        types. We observe that the pseudo-equivalent width of Fe I and

        L3.5 dwarf 2MASS J00361617+1821104, which provide the strongest
        evidence to date that the electron cyclotron maser instability
        is the dominant mechanism producing radio emission in the
        magnetospheres of ultracool dwarfs. As has previously been
        reported for the M9 dwarf TVLM 513-46546, periodic pulses of
        100\% circularly polarized, coherent radio emission are detected
        from both dwarfs with periods of 2.84 +/- 0.01 and 3.08 +/- 0.05
        hr, respectively, for LSR J1835+3259 and 2MASS
        J00361617+1821104. Importantly, periodic unpolarized radio
        emission is also detected from 2MASS J00361617+1821104, and
        brightness temperature limitations rule out gyrosynchrotron
        radiation as a source of this radio emission. The unpolarized
        emission from this and other ultracool dwarfs is also attributed
        to electron cyclotron maser emission, which has become
        depolarized on traversing the ultracool dwarf magnetosphere,
        possibly due to propagations effects such as scattering. Based
        on available vsin i data in the literature and rotation periods
        derived from the periodic radio data for the three confirmed
        sources of electron cyclotron maser emission, TVLM 513-46546,
        LSR J1835+3259, and 2MASS J00361617+1821104, we determine that
        the rotation axes of all three dwarfs are close to perpendicular
        to our line of sight. This suggests a possible geometrical
        selection effect due to the inherent directivity of electron
        cyclotron maser emission, that may account for the previously
        reported relationship between radio activity and vsin i observed
        for ultracool dwarfs. We also determine the radius of the dwarf
        LSR J1835+3259 to be $\gt$=0.117 +/- 0.012 R$_{☉}$. The implied
        size of the radius, together with the bolometric luminosity of
        the dwarf, suggests that either LSR J1835 is a young- or
        intermediate-age brown dwarf, or that current theoretical models
        underestimate the radii of ultracool dwarfs.}",

The sample of 1429 stars was identified from “The Catalog of Suspected Nearby Young Moving Group Stars.” Good-quality parallax and proper motion values were retrieved for 890 stars from the Gaia DR2 database. The analysis for membership probability is performed in the framework of the LACEwING algorithm. From the analysis it is confirmed that 279 stars do not belong to any of the known moving groups. We estimated the U, V, W space velocity values for 250 moving group members, which were found to be more accurate than previous values listed in the literature. The velocity ellipses of all the moving groups are well constrained within the “good box,” a widely used criterion to identify moving group members. The age of moving group members are uniformly estimated from the analysis of the Gaia color–magnitude diagram with MIST isochrones. We found a spread in the age distribution of stars belonging to some moving groups, which needs to be understood from further studies.}

     abstract = "{Context. Late M-type dwarfs in the solar neighborhood include a mixture
        of very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs that is difficult to
        disentangle due to the lack of constraints on their age, such as
        trigonometric parallax, lithium detection, and space velocity.
        \textbackslash Aims: We search for young brown dwarf candidates
        among a sample of 28 nearby late-M dwarfs with spectral types
        between M5.0 and M9.0, and we also search for debris disks
        around three of them. \textbackslash Methods: Based on
        theoretical models, we used the color I-J, the J-band absolute
        magnitude, and the detection of the Li I 6708 {\r{A}} doublet
        line as a strong constraint to estimate masses and ages of our
        targets. For the search of debris disks, we observed three
        targets at submillimeter wavelength of 850 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m.
        \textbackslash Results: We report here the first clear
        detections of lithium absorption in four targets and a marginal
        detection in one target. Our mass estimates indicate that two of
        them are young brown dwarfs, two are young brown dwarf
        candidates, and one is a young very low-mass star. The closest
        young field brown dwarf in our sample at only 15 pc is an
        excellent benchmark for further studying physical properties of
        brown dwarfs in the range 100-150 Myr. We did not detect any
        debris disks around three late-M dwarfs, and we estimated upper
        limits to the dust mass of debris disks around them.

     abstract = "{Low-mass stars are currently the most promising targets for detecting
        and characterizing habitable planets in the solar neighborhood.
        However, the ultraviolet (UV) radiation emitted by such stars
        can erode and modify planetary atmospheres over time,
        drastically affecting their habitability. Thus, knowledge of the
        UV evolution of low-mass stars is critical for interpreting the
        evolutionary history of any orbiting planets. Shkolnik \& Barman
        used photometry from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) to
        show how UV emission evolves for early-type M stars ($\gt$0.35 M
        $_{☉}$). In this paper, we extend their work to include both a
        larger sample of low-mass stars with known ages as well as M
        stars with lower masses. We find clear evidence that mid- and
        late-type M stars (0.08-0.35 M $_{☉}$) do not follow the same UV
        evolutionary trend as early-Ms. Lower-mass M stars retain high
        levels of UV activity up to field ages, with only a factor of 4
        decrease on average in GALEX NUV and FUV flux density between
        young ($\lt$50 Myr) and old ({\ensuremath{\sim}}5 Gyr) stars,
        compared to a factor of 11 and 31 for early-Ms in NUV and FUV,
        respectively. We also find that the FUV/NUV flux density ratio,
        which can affect the photochemistry of important planetary
        biosignatures, is mass- and age-dependent for early-Ms, but
        remains relatively constant for the mid- and late-type Ms in our
        sample.}",

        type (SpT = K3-M6) members of the Tucana-Horologium moving
        group, a nearby (d \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 40 pc),
        young ({\ensuremath{\tau}} \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 40
        Myr) population of comoving stars. We also report observations
        for 13 of the 17 known Tuc-Hor members in this spectral type
        range, and that 62 additional candidates are likely to be
        unassociated field stars; the confirmation frequency for new
        candidates is therefore 129/191 = 67\%. We have used radial
        velocities, H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emission, and Li$_{6708}$
        absorption to distinguish between contaminants and bona fide
        members. Our expanded census of Tuc-Hor increases the known
        population by a factor of \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde3 in
        total and by a factor of \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde8 for
        members with SpT $\gt$= K3, but even so, the K-M dwarf
        population of Tuc-Hor is still markedly incomplete. Our expanded
        census allows for a much more detailed study of Tuc-Hor than was
        previously feasible. The spatial distribution of members appears
        to trace a two-dimensional sheet, with a broad distribution in X
        and Y, but a very narrow distribution ({\ensuremath{\pm}}5 pc)
        in Z. The corresponding velocity distribution is very small,
        with a scatter of {\ensuremath{\pm}}1.1 km s$^{-1}$ about the
        mean UVW velocity for stars spanning the entire 50 pc extent of
        Tuc-Hor. We also show that the isochronal age
        ({\ensuremath{\tau}} \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 20-30 Myr)
        and the lithium depletion boundary age ({\ensuremath{\tau}}
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 40 Myr) disagree, following the
        trend in other pre-main-sequence populations for isochrones to
        yield systematically younger ages. The H{\ensuremath{\alpha}}
        emission line strength follows a trend of increasing equivalent
        width with later spectral type, as is seen for young clusters.
        We find that moving group members have been depleted of
        measurable lithium for spectral types of K7.0-M4.5. None of our
        targets have significant infrared excesses in the WISE W3 band,
        yielding an upper limit on warm debris disks of F $\lt$ 0.7\%.
        Finally, our purely kinematic and color-magnitude selection
        procedure allows us to test the efficiency and completeness for
        activity-based selection of young stars. We find that 60\% of
        K-M dwarfs in Tuc-Hor do not have ROSAT counterparts and would
        have been omitted in X-ray-selected samples. In contrast, GALEX
        UV-selected samples using a previously suggested criterion for
        youth achieve completeness of 77\% and purity of 78\%, and we
        suggest new SpT-dependent selection criteria that will yield
        $\gt$95\% completeness for {\ensuremath{\tau}}
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 40 Myr populations with GALEX
        data available.}",

        we are uncomfortable assigning a final, unambiguous age to the
        Argus association as our membership list for the association
        appears to suffer from a high level of contamination, and
        therefore it remains unclear whether these stars represent a
        single population of coeval stars. Our isochronal ages for both
        the BPMG and Tuc-Hor are consistent with recent lithium
        depletion boundary (LDB) ages, which unlike isochronal ages, are
        relatively insensitive to the choice of low-mass evolutionary
        models. This consistency between the isochronal and LDB ages
        instils confidence that our self-consistent, absolute age scale
        for young, nearby moving groups is robust, and hence we suggest
        that these ages be adopted for future studies of these groups.

     abstract = "{Solar eruptive phenomena embrace a variety of eruptions, including
        flares, solar energetic particles, and radio bursts. Since the
        vast majority of these are associated with the eruption,
        development, and evolution of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), we
        focus on CME observations in this review. CMEs are a key aspect
        of coronal and interplanetary dynamics. They inject large
        quantities of mass and magnetic flux into the heliosphere,
        causing major transient disturbances. CMEs can drive
        interplanetary shocks, a key source of solar energetic particles
        and are known to be the major contributor to severe space
        weather at the Earth. Studies over the past decade using the
        data sets from (among others) the SOHO, TRACE, Wind, ACE,
        STEREO, and SDO spacecraft, along with ground-based instruments,
        have improved our knowledge of the origins and development of
        CMEs at the Sun and how they contribute to space weather at
        Earth. SOHO, launched in 1995, has provided us with almost
        continuous coverage of the solar corona over more than a
        complete solar cycle, and the heliospheric imagers SMEI
        (2003-2011) and the HIs (operating since early 2007) have
        provided us with the capability to image and track CMEs
        continually across the inner heliosphere. We review some key
        coronal properties of CMEs, their source regions and their
        propagation through the solar wind. The LASCO coronagraphs
        routinely observe CMEs launched along the Sun-Earth line as
        halo-like brightenings. STEREO also permits observing Earth-
        directed CMEs from three different viewpoints of increasing
        azimuthal separation, thereby enabling the estimation of their
        three-dimensional properties. These are important not only for
        space weather prediction purposes, but also for understanding
        the development and internal structure of CMEs since we view
        their source regions on the solar disk and can measure their in-
        situ characteristics along their axes. Included in our
        discussion of the recent developments in CME-related phenomena
        are the latest developments from the STEREO and LASCO
        coronagraphs and the SMEI and HI heliospheric imagers.

        Peak observations of the L1 dwarf WISEP J190648.47+401106.8. We
        find that the Kepler optical light curve is consistent in phase
        and amplitude over nearly two years of monitoring, with a peak-
        to-peak amplitude of 1.4\%. Spitzer Infrared Array Camera 3.6
        {\ensuremath{\mu}}m observations are in phase with Kepler, with
        similar light curve shapes and peak-to-peak amplitudes of 1.1\%,
        but at 4.5 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m, the variability has an amplitude
        of \textbackslashlt 0.1\%. Chromospheric H{\ensuremath{\alpha}}
        emission is variable but not synced with the stable Kepler light
        curve. A single dark spot can reproduce the light curve but is
        not a unique solution. An inhomogeneous cloud deck, specifically
        a region of thick cloud cover, can explain the multi-wavelength
        data of this ultracool dwarf and need not be coupled with the
        asynchronous magnetic emission variations. The long life of the

        States Air Force/Mount Wilson data set, supplied by the NOAA
        World Data Center, to confirm the relation between
        {\ensuremath{\delta}} spots and large flares. We found that
        after correcting some errors we were able to describe
        relationships among active region size, peak flare soft X-ray
        (SXR) flux (measured by GOES 1-8 {\r{A}} flux), and magnetic
        classification. We found the Solar Optical Observing Network
        magnetic classification to be reasonably accurate but its area
        measures to be inaccurate for many of the regions. This is due
        partly to transcription errors and partly to wrong correction
        for limb foreshortening. Errors could, however, be repaired by
        intercomparison of multiple observations. We confirm
        K{\"u}nzel's original idea that regions classified
        {\ensuremath{\beta}}{\ensuremath{\gamma}}{\ensuremath{\delta}}
        produce many more large flares than other regions of comparable
        size. Almost all substantial flares occurred in regions
        classified
        {\ensuremath{\beta}}{\ensuremath{\gamma}}{\ensuremath{\delta}}
        by the Air Force sites. Each region larger than 1000
        {\ensuremath{\mu}}h and classified
        {\ensuremath{\beta}}{\ensuremath{\gamma}}{\ensuremath{\delta}}
        had nearly 40\% probability of producing flares classified X1 or
        greater. Yet only a half-dozen of those, showing the ``island
        delta'' configuration, produced great activity. There is a
        general trend for large regions to produce large flares, but it
        is less significant than the dependence on magnetic class.}",

        of 10 km s$^{-1}$ on average, radial velocity surveys targeting
        this stellar population will likely need to find methods to
        effectively remove starspot jitter. We present the first high
        resolution Doppler images of the M4.5 dwarf, GJ 791.2A, and the
        M9 dwarf, LP 944-20. The time series spectra of both objects
        reveal numerous line profile distortions over the rotation
        period of each star, which we interpret as starspots. The
        transient distortions are modeled with spot/photosphere contrast
        ratios that correspond to model atmosphere temperature
        differences of \{T\}$_{\{phot}$\}-\{T\}$_{\{spot}$\} = 300 and
        200 K. GJ 791.2A is a fully convective star with v sin i = 35.1
        km s$^{-1}$. Although we find more starspot structure at high
        latitudes, we reconstruct spots at a range of phases and
        latitudes with a mean spot filling of {\ensuremath{\sim}}3\%. LP
        944-20 is one of the brightest known late-M dwarfs, with
        spectral type M9V and v sin i = 30.8 km s$^{-1}$. Its spectral
        time series exhibits two dominant transient line distortions
        that are reconstructed as high latitude spots, while a mean spot
        filling factor of only 1.5\% is found. The occurrence of low-
        contrast spots at predominantly high latitudes, which we see in
        both targets here, is, in general, likely to be responsible for
        the low amplitude photometric variability seen in late-M dwarfs.
        For GJ 791.2A, the radial velocities induced by the starspot
        features yield an rms velocity variability of 138 m s$^{-1}$,
        which can be reduced by a factor of 1.9 using our reconstructed
        surface brightness distributions.}",

        convective (FC) stars are capable of generating strong magnetic

        different from the solar dynamo is at work in these objects. We
        present a self-consistent three-dimensional model of magnetic
        field generation in low-mass FC stars. The model utilizes the
        anelastic magnetohydrodynamic equations to simulate compressible
        convection in a rotating sphere. A distributed dynamo working in
        the model spontaneously produces a dipole-dominated surface
        magnetic field of the observed strength. The interaction of this
        field with the turbulent convection in outer layers shreds it,
        producing small-scale fields that carry most of the magnetic
        flux. The Zeeman-Doppler-Imaging technique applied to synthetic
        spectropolarimetric data based on our model recovers most of the

     abstract = "{Many fully convective stars exhibit a wide variety of surface magnetism,
        including starspots and chromospheric activity. The manner by
        which bundles of magnetic field traverse portions of the
        convection zone to emerge at the stellar surface is not
        especially well understood. In the solar context, some insight
        into this process has been gleaned by regarding the magnetism as
        consisting partly of idealized thin flux tubes (TFTs). Here we
        present the results of a large set of TFT simulations in a
        rotating spherical domain of convective flows representative of
        a 0.3 M $_{☉}$ main-sequence star. This is the first study to
        investigate how individual flux tubes in such a star might rise
        under the combined influence of buoyancy, convection, and
        differential rotation. A time-dependent hydrodynamic convective
        flow field, taken from separate 3D simulations calculated with
        the anelastic equations, impacts the flux tube as it rises.
        Convective motions modulate the shape of the initially buoyant
        flux ring, promoting localized rising loops. Flux tubes in fully
        convective stars have a tendency to rise nearly parallel to the
        rotation axis. However, the presence of strong differential
        rotation allows some initially low-latitude flux tubes of
        moderate strength to develop rising loops that emerge in the
        near-equatorial region. Magnetic pumping suppresses the global
        rise of the flux tube most efficiently in the deeper interior
        and at lower latitudes. The results of these simulations aim to
        provide a link between dynamo-generated magnetic fields, fluid
        motions, and observations of starspots for fully convective
        stars. \textbackslash\textbackslash}",

     abstract = "{The CARMENES radial velocity (RV) survey is observing 324 M dwarfs to
        search for any orbiting planets. In this paper, we present the
        survey sample by publishing one CARMENES spectrum for each M
        dwarf. These spectra cover the wavelength range 520-1710 nm at a
        resolution of at least R \&gt;80 000, and we measure its RV,
        H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emission, and projected rotation
        velocity. We present an atlas of high-resolution M-dwarf spectra
        and compare the spectra to atmospheric models. To quantify the
        RV precision that can be achieved in low-mass stars over the
        CARMENES wavelength range, we analyze our empirical information
        on the RV precision from more than 6500 observations. We compare
        our high-resolution M-dwarf spectra to atmospheric models where
        we determine the spectroscopic RV information content, Q, and
        signal-to-noise ratio. We find that for all M-type dwarfs, the
        highest RV precision can be reached in the wavelength range
        700-900 nm. Observations at longer wavelengths are equally
        precise only at the very latest spectral types (M8 and M9). We
        demonstrate that in this spectroscopic range, the large amount
        of absorption features compensates for the intrinsic faintness
        of an M7 star. To reach an RV precision of 1 m s$^{-1}$ in very
        low mass M dwarfs at longer wavelengths likely requires the use
        of a 10 m class telescope. For spectral types M6 and earlier,
        the combination of a red visual and a near-infrared spectrograph
        is ideal to search for low-mass planets and to distinguish
        between planets and stellar variability. At a 4 m class
        telescope, an instrument like CARMENES has the potential to push
        the RV precision well below the typical jitter level of 3-4 m
        s$^{-1}$.}",

     abstract = "{Context. Magnetic fields in cool stars can be investigated by measuring
        Zeeman line broadening and polarization in atomic and molecular
        lines. Similar to the Sun, these fields are complex and height-
        dependent. Many molecular lines dominating M-dwarf spectra
        (e.g., FeH, CaH, MgH, and TiO) are temperature- and Zeeman-
        sensitive and form at different atmospheric heights, which makes
        them excellent probes of magnetic fields on M dwarfs.
        \textbackslash Aims: Our goal is to analyze the complexity of
        magnetic fields in M dwarfs. We investigate how magnetic fields
        vary with the stellar temperature and how ``surface''
        inhomogeneities are distributed in height - the dimension that
        is usually neglected in stellar magnetic studies. \textbackslash
        Methods: We have determined effective temperatures of the
        photosphere and of magnetic features, magnetic field strengths
        and filling factors for nine M dwarfs (M1-M7). Our
        {\ensuremath{\chi}}$^{2}$ analysis is based on a comparison of
        observed and synthetic intensity and circular polarization
        profiles. Stokes profiles were calculated by solving polarized
        radiative transfer equations. \textbackslash Results: Properties
        of magnetic structures depend on the analyzed atomic or
        molecular species and their formation heights. Two types of
        magnetic features similar to those on the Sun have been found: a
        cooler (starspots) and a hotter (network) one. The magnetic
        field strength in both starspots and network is within 3-6 kG,
        on average it is 5 kG. These fields occupy a large fraction of M
        dwarf atmospheres at all heights, up to 100\%. The plasma
        {\ensuremath{\beta}} is less than one, implying highly
        magnetized stars. \textbackslash Conclusions: A combination of
        molecular and atomic species and a simultaneous analysis of
        intensity and circular polarization spectra have allowed us to
        better decipher the complexity of magnetic fields on M dwarfs,
        including their dependence on the atmospheric height. This work
        provides an opportunity to investigate a larger sample of M
        dwarfs and L-type brown dwarfs. \textbackslash\textbackslashThe

    Abstract = {Between 1997 June and 2001 February the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) collected 25.4 Tbytes of raw imaging data covering 99.998% of the celestial sphere in the near-infrared J (1.25 mum), H (1.65 mum), and Ks (2.16 mum) bandpasses. Observations were conducted from two dedicated 1.3 m diameter telescopes located at Mount Hopkins, Arizona, and Cerro Tololo, Chile. The 7.8 s of integration time accumulated for each point on the sky and strict quality control yielded a 10 sigma point-source detection level of better than 15.8, 15.1, and 14.3 mag at the J, H, and Ks bands, respectively, for virtually the entire sky. Bright source extractions have 1 sigma photometric uncertainty of <0.03 mag and astrometric accuracy of order 100 mas. Calibration offsets between any two points in the sky are <0.02 mag. The 2MASS All-Sky Data Release includes 4.1 million compressed FITS images covering the entire sky, 471 million source extractions in a Point Source Catalog, and 1.6 million objects identified as extended in an Extended Source Catalog.},

We report mean spectral properties (molecular band-head strengths, equivalent widths) and use the templates to investigate the effects of magnetic activity and metallicity on the spectroscopic and photometric properties of low-mass stars.},

	Abstract = {We present optical template spectra, bolometric corrections, and Ï values for ultracool dwarfs. The templates are based on spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Astrophysical Research Consortium 3.5 m telescope. The spectral features and overall shape of the L dwarf templates are consistent with previous spectroscopic standards and the templates have a radial velocity precision of Ë10-20 km s-1. We calculate bolometric fluxes (accurate to 10-20%) for 101 late-M and L dwarfs from SDSS, 2MASS, and WISE photometry, SDSS spectra, and BT-Settl model spectra. We find that the z-band and J-band bolometric corrections for late-M and L dwarfs have a strong correlation with z-J and J-KScolors, respectively. The new Ï values, which can be used to convert HÎ± equivalent widths to activity strength, are based on spectrophotometrically calibrated SDSS spectra and the new bolometric fluxes. While the measured Ï values have typical uncertainties of Ë20%, ultracool dwarf models show the continuum surrounding HÎ± can vary by up to an order of magnitude with changing surface gravity. Our semiempirical Ï values are one to two orders of magnitude larger than previous Ï values for mid-to-late L dwarfs, indicating that the upper limits for HÎ± activity strength on the coolest L dwarfs have been underestimated.},

@article{mann2015,
	Abstract = {Precise and accurate parameters for late-type (late K and M) dwarf stars are important for characterization of any orbiting planets, but such determinations have been hampered by these stars' complex spectra and dissimilarity to the Sun. We exploit an empirically calibrated method to estimate spectroscopic effective temperature (Teff) and the Stefan--Boltzmann law to determine radii of 183 nearby K7--M7 single stars with a precision of 2%--5%. Our improved stellar parameters enable us to develop model-independent relations between Teff or absolute magnitude and radius, as well as between color and Teff. The derived Teff--radius relation depends strongly on [Fe/H], as predicted by theory. The relation between absolute KS magnitude and radius can predict radii accurate to 3%. We derive bolometric corrections to the V{{R}C}{{I}C}grizJH{{K}S} and Gaia passbands as a function of color, accurate to 1%--3%. We confront the reliability of predictions from Dartmouth stellar evolution models using a Markov chain Monte Carlo to find the values of unobservable model parameters (mass, age) that best reproduce the observed effective temperature and bolometric flux while satisfying constraints on distance and metallicity as Bayesian priors. With the inferred masses we derive a semi-empirical mass--absolute magnitude relation with a scatter of 2% in mass. The best-agreement models overpredict stellar Teff values by an average of 2.2% and underpredict stellar radii by 4.6%, similar to differences with values from low-mass eclipsing binaries. These differences are not correlated with metallicity, mass, or indicators of activity, suggesting issues with the underlying model assumptions, e.g., opacities or convective mixing length.},

        of 334 M dwarfs of spectral types M0-M4.5 populating the
        parameter space around the boundary to full convection. We
        obtain high-resolution optical spectra for 206 targets and
        determine projected rotational velocity, vsin i, and
        H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emission. The data are combined with
        measurements of vsin i in field stars of the same spectral type
        from the literature. Our sample adds 157 new rotation
        measurements to the existing literature and almost doubles the
        sample of available vsin i. The final sample provides a
        statistically meaningful picture of rotation and activity at the
        transition to full convection in the solar neighborhood. We
        confirm a steep rise in the fraction of active stars at the
        transition to full convection known from earlier work. In
        addition, we see a clear rise in rotational velocity in the same
        stars. In very few stars, no chromospheric activity but a
        detection of rotational broadening is reported. We argue that
        all of them are probably spurious detections; we conclude that
        in our sample all significantly rotating stars are active, and
        all active stars are significantly rotating. The rotation-
        activity relation is valid in partially and in fully convective
        stars. Thus, we do not observe any evidence for a transition
        from a rotationally dominated dynamo in partially convective
        stars to a rotation-independent turbulent dynamo in fully
        convective stars; turbulent dynamos in fully convective stars of
        spectral types around M4 are still driven by rotation. Finally,
        we compare projected rotational velocities of 33 stars to
        rotational periods derived from photometry in the literature and
        determine inclinations for a few of them.}",

     abstract = "{Aims: Flares on dM stars contain plasmas at very different temperatures
        and thus affect a wide wavelength range in the electromagnetic
        spectrum. While the coronal properties of flares are studied
        best in X-rays, the chromosphere of the star is observed best in
        the optical and ultraviolet ranges. Therefore, multiwavelength
        observations are essential to study flare properties throughout
        the atmosphere of a star. \textbackslashMethods: We analysed
        simultaneous observations with UVES/VLT and XMM-Newton of the
        active M5.5 dwarf CN Leo (Gl 406) exhibiting a major flare. The
        optical data cover the wavelength range from 3000 to 10 000
        {\r{A}}. \textbackslashResults: From our optical data, we find
        an enormous wealth of chromospheric emission lines occurring
        throughout the spectrum. We identify a total of 1143 emission
        lines, out of which 154 are located in the red arm, increasing
        the number of observed emission lines in this red wavelength
        range by about a factor of 10. Here we present an emission line
        list and a spectral atlas. We also find line asymmetries for H
        I, He I, and Ca II lines. For the last, this is the first
        observation of asymmetries due to a stellar flare. During the
        flare onset, there is additional flux found in the blue wing,
        while in the decay phase, additional flux is found in the red
        wing. We interpret both features as caused by mass motions. In
        addition to the lines, the flare manifests itself in the
        enhancement of the continuum throughout the whole spectrum,
        inverting the normal slope for the net flare spectrum.

        the European Southern Observatory, Paranal, Chile, 077.D-0011(A)

     abstract = "{We aim to understand how stellar parameters such as mass and rotation
        impact the distribution of star-spots on the stellar surface. To
        this purpose, we have used Doppler imaging to reconstruct the
        surface brightness distributions of three fully convective M
        dwarfs with similar rotation rates. We secured high cadence
        spectral time series observations of the 5.5 au separation
        binary GJ 65, comprising GJ 65A (M5.5V, P$_{rot}$ = 0.24 d) and
        GJ 65B (M6V, P$_{rot}$ = 0.23 d). We also present new
        observations of GJ 791.2A (M4.5V, P$_{rot}$ = 0.31 d).
        Observations of each star were made on two nights with UVES,
        covering a wavelength range from 0.64 - 1.03{\ensuremath{\mu}}m.
        The time series spectra reveal multiple line distortions that we
        interpret as cool star-spots and which are persistent on both
        nights suggesting stability on the time-scale of 3 d. Spots are
        recovered with resolutions down to 8.3{\textdegree} at the
        equator. The global spot distributions for GJ 791.2A are similar
        to observations made a year earlier. Similar high latitude and
        circumpolar spot structure is seen on GJ 791.2A and GJ 65A.
        However, they are surprisingly absent on GJ 65B, which instead
        reveals more extensive, larger, spots concentrated at
        intermediate latitudes. All three stars show small amplitude
        latitude-dependent rotation that is consistent with solid body
        rotation. We compare our measurements of differential rotation
        with previous Doppler imaging studies and discuss the results in
        the wider context of other observational estimates and recent
        theoretical predictions.}",

abstract={Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},
